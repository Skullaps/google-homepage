# google-homepage
This will be my first attempt at a full html file with CSS styling

Hoping to clone the google homepage.

Completed the HTML structure and the basic styling. Had some issues with
flexbox and also default css styles, so I added a reset.css to my workflow.


Unsure how to proceed with the search bar + button layout, seems I have 2 
options:
1: Use 2 seperate divs, 1 for bar 1 for buttons with flex
2: Use one container with gridbox 

I will likely try the grid approach as have little to no hands on
experience with it currently.


Still have yet to add base style such as fonts etc, also need to look
into icons and how to add and use them.

Spent roughly 2/3 hours on it so far. Surprised with the outcome and how quick
I have picked up the basics of CSS, also intimidated but excited about the 
wide range of possibilities and attributes etc. Not even thought about JS yet D:.
